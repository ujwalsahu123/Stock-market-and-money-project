projects etc ..... 


also think idea - making trading as cash of clans . where there are models provided ( barbarian (historical data priority), archar(future prediction priority) , technical analysis more priority , fundamental analysis more priority , all normal priority ,like good in attack but bad in defence , each tropps has his characteristics - time money attach defence moment speed range etc ,  mix , etc ) and you can put them into the game (trading) 
and now they are trading for you . coding people can make their own models also by hardcoding on their device , but they cannot compete with our models , . 
so our platform is not for software people , we make superb models and no need to learn technical skills like coding , etc .. to particiapte . just choose a model or multiple model and put it into a particular stock or crypto or derivative . 
(also if u think u get the best model amd put it into all stock then you win in all - no , since every stock is differnt play , and it also depends - which number of model is more in which stock , so that model is dominant and will win since it controls that stock now . also each barbarian play by their own mind so each users ai mdoel is playing by thir own mind , so now no dominance .  and there are normal human traders , larger plyers , etc ....

in the end , there will be no human traders , since models are better and will always or mostly eat them . amd in the end all models compete with each other . 

think more on this idea .
